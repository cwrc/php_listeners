<config>
    
    <listeners>
        <!-- Choose the number of child processes you want to spawn. 
         i    A rough estimate is you'll get a load average which is 
             1.5 times the number of child processes (eg. load average 
             of 12 for 8 child processes -->
        <child_processes>2</child_processes>    
    </listeners>

        <!-- These are the details for your Fedora server. You should
             make sure that the firewall rules allow the listeners to
             contact the Fedora server and set up any XACML policies 
             to allow write access from the listener IP address -->

        <!-- These are the details for the JMS broker. Usually the host
             will be the same as the Fedora server. If the Stomp port on
             the JMS broker has been set up as in the installation 
             instructions then you'll connect on port 61613 and use the
             /queue/listener.update channel -->

    <log>

         the webserver AND the user used to invoke the listeners both need
        to have write access to this file -->
        <file>/var/log/listener.log</file>
